# Section Shared Contract — Insightful Product 3.0

> Referenced by all section guides (§1–§6). Contains processes that are identical
> across sections. Each section guide provides section-specific parameters;
> this file provides the canonical process. **Do not duplicate these processes
> in individual guides.**

## 1. Pre-Build Gate Check Process

Before generating any HTML for a section:

1. Open `cache/gate_flags.md` and `cache/section_confidence.md`.
2. For each row in the section guide's **PRE-BUILD GATE CHECK** table:
   - Check the gate condition against `gate_flags.md`.
   - Check whether the cache file exists AND contains data rows.
   - Record: subsection name, MANDATORY or CONDITIONAL, gate MET or NOT MET.
3. **Write down your list** of subsections that will render before proceeding.
   Use this list as a checklist while building the fragment.
4. Skipping a MANDATORY subsection when its gate is met = **defective fragment**.

## 2. Data Confidence Header (MANDATORY for §2–§5)

Every section fragment (§2 through §5) MUST include a data confidence header.
If this header is missing, the fragment is **DEFECTIVE**.

**STEP 1 — Read the tier.** Open `cache/section_confidence.md` and read the
EXACT value of `SECTION_CONFIDENCE_N` (where N is this section's number). The
value is one of: `FULL`, `STRONG`, `PARTIAL`, `LIMITED`. **Use THIS value.
Do NOT infer or recompute the tier from gate flags — the data gathering script
already computed it.**

**STEP 2 — Select the template** from the section guide's confidence header
table (each guide defines its own template IDs, variable sources, and fallback
rules).

**STEP 3 — Position the header:** ALWAYS immediately after the header metrics,
BEFORE the first subsection content. This applies to ALL tiers including FULL.

**STEP 4 — Build the HTML:**

```html
<div class="data-confidence">
  <span class="data-confidence-label">{{TIER_LABEL}}</span>
  <span class="data-confidence-action">{{TEMPLATE_TEXT}}</span>
</div>
```

If the tier is `LIMITED`, use `<div class="data-confidence limited">` instead.

§6 (Platform Context) does NOT use a confidence header.

## 3. Fragment Wrapper

Sections §2–§5 use the `<details class="section-collapse">` wrapper per
`shared_rules.md` Section C. Each section guide specifies its Section ID and
Section Number.

**CORRECT HTML structure** (match exactly — rendering breaks if elements are
outside `<summary>` or wrong tag types are used):

```html
<details class="section-collapse" id="{{SECTION_ID}}">
  <summary>
    <div class="section-title">{{SECTION_TITLE}}</div>
    <div class="section-sub">{{ONE-LINE STATS}}</div>
    <div class="section-contents">{{SUBSECTION_NAMES joined by · middots}}</div>
    <span class="expand-hint">Expand section</span>
  </summary>
  <div class="section">
    {{ALL SECTION CONTENT HERE}}
  </div>
</details>
```

Rules:
- `section-title` MUST be a `<div>`, not a `<span>`.
- `section-sub`, `section-contents`, and `expand-hint` MUST be INSIDE `<summary>`.
- If ANY of these elements are placed outside `<summary>`, the collapsed state
  renders incorrectly (text visible when section is collapsed).
- `section-contents` lists ONLY subsections that actually rendered (not skipped).

§1 (Signal Summary) renders as an open `<div class="section">` — it does NOT use `<details>`.
§6 (Platform Context) renders as a collapsed `<details>` (user must click to expand).

## 4. Highlight File Output

After building each section fragment, save `cache/section_NN_highlights.md`
per `shared_rules.md` Section K:

- 2–4 candidate highlights from the section's strongest signals.
- Each: bold headline + one sentence context + dollar figure + `surprise_score`
  + `signal_id` + section deep-link (e.g., `[→ §accounts]`).
- 0–1 priority action candidates with urgency level.
- At least 1 highlight MUST be positive.

Exception: §1 (Signal Summary) does NOT produce a highlights file — it consumes
highlights from all other sections. §6 produces 1–2 highlights only when issues
are severe (>180d staleness).

---

## 5. Conditional Subsection Checklist Process

Before saving a section fragment, verify against the section guide's
**Conditional Subsection Checklist** table:

1. For each row: confirm the subsection was rendered if its gate was met, or
   correctly skipped if its gate was not met.
2. Confirm the `section-contents` middot list in the HTML matches ONLY the
   subsections that actually rendered (not skipped ones).
3. Confirm every rendered subsection (except those noted otherwise in the guide)
   ends with a `<div class="what-this-means">` block that:
   - Starts with `<strong>Action:</strong>`
   - Contains max 3 sentences total
   - Names a specific entity and action (not generic advice)
4. Confirm the section-level `.what-this-means` is present (max 3 sentences,
   starts with `<strong>Action:</strong>`)
   — except §1 and §6 which have different rules per their guides.

## 6. Forbidden Terms Verification

Before saving any fragment, verify NONE of the following appear in the HTML:

| Forbidden | Replacement |
|-----------|-------------|
| ERP | "total business", "all-channel orders", "orders synced from your systems" |
| Mixpanel | "app usage data", "engagement events" |
| Clicky | Do not reference — suppress data source |
| health score | Use "Engagement Score" (§2 only) or describe the pattern |
| Segment labels (Platform-Embedded, etc.) | Describe the behavior instead |
| Internal IDs (org_id, customer_code, query IDs) | Remove entirely |
| Literal `[HYPOTHETICAL]` or `[ESTIMATED]` in HTML | Use prose hedging ("estimated", "projected") |
| portal orders / portal ordering | "total business", "all-channel orders" |
| platform (standalone) | "eCat", "the app", "your digital catalog" |
| platform-attributed revenue | "orders placed through eCat", "eCat volume" |
| platform engagement | "app usage", "digital catalog activity" |

Also verify:
- Every dollar figure has a time qualifier.
- Every finding names a specific entity — no generic "your accounts."
- Tables: top 5 visible, remainder in `<details>` (unless spec says otherwise).
