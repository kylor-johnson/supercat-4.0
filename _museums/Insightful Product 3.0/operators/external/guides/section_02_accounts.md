# Section Guide: Account Intelligence
> **v3.0** — signal-first architecture. The core value section.

## Section Identity

- **id**: `accounts`
- **title**: Account Intelligence
- **section number**: 2

## PRE-BUILD GATE CHECK — Complete Before Writing Any HTML

> Follow `section_shared_contract.md` §1 for the gate check process.

| Cache File | Gate Condition | If gate met + data rows exist → | Subsection |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Q-52_results.md` | `PORTAL_CUSTOMER_DATA_PRESENT = true` | **MUST render** | 3b (eCat Penetration) |
| `Q-14b_results.md` | `HAS_PORTAL_ORDERS = true` | **MUST render** | 8b (Deceleration Alert) |
| `Q-57_results.md` | `HAS_PORTAL_ORDERS = true` + `PORTAL_CUSTOMER_DATA_PRESENT = true` | **MUST render** | 9 (Cross-Sell Whitespace) |
| `Q-67_results.md` | `HAS_PORTAL_ORDERS = true` + `PORTAL_CUSTOMER_DATA_PRESENT = true` | **MUST render** | 11 (Geographic Trends) |
| `Q-68_results.md` | `HAS_PORTAL_ORDERS = true` + `PORTAL_CUSTOMER_DATA_PRESENT = true` | **MUST render** | 12 (Spending Contraction) |

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

These rules are non-negotiable. Failing ANY of them produces a defective fragment:

1. **MANDATORY SUBSECTIONS**: Every row in the Pre-Build Gate Check table above where the gate is met AND the cache file has data rows MUST produce a rendered subsection. If you skip one, the fragment is defective.
2. **CONFIDENCE HEADER**: Every §2 fragment MUST contain a confidence header **at the top of the section** (immediately after the header metrics, before any subsection content). This is NOT optional — if the confidence header is missing, the fragment is defective. Read `SECTION_CONFIDENCE_2` from `section_confidence.md` — use the EXACT tier value, do NOT infer it from gate flags.
3. **SIGNAL-FIRST ARCHITECTURE**: The mini-briefs (subsection 3) remain the core of this section. New subsections ADD depth after mini-briefs — they do not replace them.

## Fragment Structure

Uses the standard `<details class="section-collapse">` wrapper per shared_rules.md Section E.

```
Section ID: accounts
Section Number: §2
```

## Content Blocks (render in NARRATIVE ARC order below)

**Rendering order within this section (intelligence → opportunity → risk):**
1. Header Metrics (mandatory)
2. Data Confidence Header (MANDATORY — renders at TOP of section, immediately after metrics)
3. Top 10 Mini-Briefs (mandatory — internal arc: trajectory → NBP → decay → displacement)
3b. eCat Penetration (INTELLIGENCE)
11. Geographic Revenue Trends (INTELLIGENCE)
10. Buyer-Within-Account Intelligence (INTELLIGENCE)
9. Untapped Category Opportunities (OPPORTUNITY)
5. Unactivated High-Value Accounts (OPPORTUNITY)
6. Geographic Distribution (neutral)
8. Reorder Velocity & Early Warning (early warning)
4. Dormant High-Value Accounts (RISK)
7. Velocity Deceleration (RISK)
12. Spending Contraction (RISK — render last, collapsed)

### 1. Header Metrics (MANDATORY)

Four `.metric-card` items in a `.metrics-grid`:

| Metric | Source | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Total Accounts | Q-12 | All account records in system |
| Active Accounts (12mo) | Q-12 | Accounts with ≥ 1 order in trailing 12 months |
| Active Accounts (90d) | Q-12 | Accounts with ≥ 1 order in last 90 days |
| Avg LTM Revenue per Active Account | Computed | Total LTM GMV ÷ active (12mo) count |

Every metric-card includes a `.metric-note` with time qualifier.

### 2. Data Confidence Header (MANDATORY — ALWAYS AT TOP)

> Follow `section_shared_contract.md` §2 for the confidence header process.

Read `SECTION_CONFIDENCE_2` from `cache/section_confidence.md`.

| Tier | Template | Label |
|---|---|---|
| `FULL` | `§2-FULL` | `FULL PICTURE` |
| `STRONG` | `§2-STRONG` | `STRONG VIEW` |
| `PARTIAL` | `§2-PARTIAL` | `PARTIAL VIEW` |
| `LIMITED` | `§2-PARTIAL` (with `.limited` class) | `LIMITED VIEW` |

Resolve template variables: `{{ACCOUNT_COUNT}}` from `gate_flags.md`, `{{LAST_PORTAL_ORDER_DATE}}` from enrichment preflight in `gate_flags.md`. If `{{ACCOUNT_COUNT}}` cannot be resolved, omit the parenthetical. If `{{LAST_PORTAL_ORDER_DATE}}` cannot be resolved for FULL or STRONG, fall back to `§2-PARTIAL`.

### 3. Top 10 Accounts by Signal Density (MANDATORY)

This is the core of the section. Source: `cache/top_accounts.md`.

**Top 5 accounts**: Fully rendered mini-briefs (see Mini-Brief Spec below).

**Accounts 6–10**: Rendered inside a collapsed `<details>` block:

```html
<details>
  <summary>Accounts 6–10 by signal density &#9662;</summary>
  {{MINI_BRIEFS_6_THROUGH_10}}
</details>
```

---

## Mini-Brief Spec (per account)

Each mini-brief renders as a `.subsection` with the account name as `.subsection-title`. Include ONLY the components where the relevant signal fired for this account. Skip components silently when their signal did not fire.

**RENDER ORDER within each mini-brief follows the narrative arc:**
1. Account Header (mandatory) — establishes the relationship
2. Spending Trajectory — if accelerating, this is the LEAD story (positive)
2b. Wallet Share & Category Whitespace — intelligence/opportunity (shows the full relationship)
3. Companion products — opportunity framing
4. Reorder Decay — risk (only after positive context)
5. Stock-Out Impact — operational risk
6. Competitive Displacement — strategic risk
7. Pre-Meeting Priority (mandatory) — action close

### A. Account Header (MANDATORY for every mini-brief)

```html
<div class="metrics-grid">
  <div class="metric-card">
    <div class="metric-val">{{CUSTOMER_NAME}}</div>
    <div class="metric-label">{{CITY}}, {{STATE}}</div>
  </div>
  <div class="metric-card">
    <div class="metric-val">{{LAST_ORDER_DATE}}</div>
    <div class="metric-label">Last Order</div>
    <div class="metric-note {{warn_if_stale}}">{{DAYS_SINCE}} days ago</div>
  </div>
  <div class="metric-card">
    <div class="metric-val">${{LTM_REVENUE}}</div>
    <div class="metric-label">LTM Revenue</div>
    <div class="metric-note {{ok_or_warn}}">{{YOY_CHANGE}}% YoY</div>
  </div>
  <div class="metric-card">
    <div class="metric-val"><span class="badge {{SCORE_BADGE_CLASS}}">{{ENGAGEMENT_SCORE}}</span></div>
    <div class="metric-label">Engagement Score</div>
    <div class="metric-note">{{SCORE_LABEL}}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Use `.metric-note.warn` if last order > 60 days. Use `.metric-note.danger` if > 120 days. YoY change: `.ok` if positive, `.warn` if -1% to -15%, `.danger` if < -15%.

**Engagement Score Computation** (per account):

A composite 0–100 score blending four dimensions. Compute for every mini-brief account:

| Dimension | Weight | Scoring (0–25 each) |
|-----------|--------|---------------------|
| **Recency** | 25% | 25 if last order ≤ 14 days. Linear decay: 25 × (1 - days_since/365). Floor at 0 if > 365 days. |
| **Frequency** | 25% | 25 if order count ≥ org's 90th percentile. Scale linearly from 0 (1 order) to 25 (90th pctile). |
| **Monetary** | 25% | 25 if LTM revenue ≥ org's 90th percentile. Scale linearly from 0 ($0) to 25 (90th pctile). |
| **Trajectory** | 25% | 25 if YoY growth > 50%. 20 if 20–50%. 15 if 0–20%. 10 if -10% to 0%. 5 if -25% to -10%. 0 if < -25%. |

`ENGAGEMENT_SCORE = Recency + Frequency + Monetary + Trajectory` (integer 0–100)

| Score Range | Badge Class | Label |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| 80–100 | `.badge.ok` | Champion |
| 60–79 | `.badge.ok` | Strong |
| 40–59 | `.badge.muted` | Moderate |
| 20–39 | `.badge.warn` | Cooling |
| 0–19 | `.badge.danger` | At Risk |

**Purpose**: Gives the reader a single sortable number to prioritize accounts. A "Champion" with a decay signal is more urgent than an "At Risk" account that was always low-value. The score contextualizes the signals that follow.

**IMPORTANT**: "Engagement Score" is permitted — it is a composite behavioral metric, not a health score. Never call this a "health score" in client-facing text (banned per shared_rules.md).

### B. Spending Trajectory (conditional: Q-ORG-VELOCITY or Q-ORG-CONTRACTION data exists for this account)

QoQ revenue trend with inflection callout. **This renders FIRST after the header because acceleration is the strongest positive signal.**

```html
<div class="callout insight">
  <div class="callout-title">Spending Trajectory</div>
  <p>Quarterly trend: ${{Q-3}} → ${{Q-2}} → ${{Q-1}} → ${{Q-CURRENT}}</p>
  <p>{{INFLECTION_NARRATIVE}}</p>
</div>
```

`INFLECTION_NARRATIVE`: If accelerating (SIG-MOM-01), frame positively: "Accelerating at X% QoQ for N consecutive quarters — annualized run rate: $Y." If contracting (SIG-DECAY-04), frame constructively: "Total business contracted X% YoY ($PRIOR → $LTM) — a $GAP recovery opportunity if engagement momentum returns."

### B2. Wallet Share & Category Whitespace (conditional: `HAS_PORTAL_ORDERS = true` AND Q-52/Q-57 data exists for this account)

**Gate**: Only renders when portal_orders data is available for this specific account AND either (a) Q-52 shows total business context, or (b) Q-57 shows category gaps for this account.

This component answers: "How much of this account's total spend do we capture, and what categories are they NOT buying from us that similar accounts buy?"

```html
<div class="callout insight">
  <div class="callout-title">Wallet Position</div>
  <p><strong>Total relationship:</strong> ${{TOTAL_BUSINESS_GMV}} across all channels | <strong>eCat share:</strong> ${{ECAT_GMV}} ({{PENETRATION_PCT}}%)</p>
  {{IF category_gaps_exist:}}
  <p><strong>Category whitespace:</strong> This account buys in {{ACTIVE_CATEGORIES}} categories but has $0 in {{MISSING_CATEGORY_1}}{{IF more: ", {{MISSING_CATEGORY_2}}"}}, where similar accounts average ${{PEER_MEDIAN}} annually.</p>
  {{/IF}}
</div>
```

**Construction rules:**
- `TOTAL_BUSINESS_GMV`: From Q-52 data for this account (all-channel GMV)
- `ECAT_GMV`: eCat-originated GMV for this account
- `PENETRATION_PCT`: `ECAT_GMV / TOTAL_BUSINESS_GMV × 100`
- `MISSING_CATEGORY_1/2`: From Q-57 data filtered for this account — categories where this account has zero purchases but peer accounts (similar revenue, same region) actively buy. Show top 2 by peer median spend.
- `PEER_MEDIAN`: The median annual spend in that category across similar accounts

**Framing**: This is about the SIZE of the relationship and the SHAPE of what they buy vs. what they could buy. It turns a one-dimensional revenue number into a multi-dimensional opportunity map. "You know this account does $2.7M with you — but they buy nothing in Mirrors or Bath Lighting, where accounts their size typically do $150K."

**When Q-57 data is unavailable for this account**: Render only the wallet position line (total business + eCat share) without the category whitespace paragraph.

### C. Companion Products (conditional: SIG-OPP-01 data available for this account)

```html
<div class="callout opportunity">
  <div class="callout-title">Products Frequently Bought Together</div>
  <p><strong>{{N}}</strong> customers who buy <strong>{{ANCHOR_ITEM}}</strong> ({{ANCHOR_DESC}}) also buy <strong>{{SUGGESTED_ITEM}}</strong> ({{SUGGESTED_DESC}}) — this account hasn't.</p>
  <p>Estimated opportunity: ${{AVG_REVENUE}} based on {{N}}-customer purchase pattern.</p>
</div>
```

If multiple NBP signals fired for this account, show top 2 by estimated opportunity. Rest omitted.

### D. Reorder Decay (conditional: SIG-DECAY-01 or SIG-DECAY-02 fired for this account)

Use `.callout.insight` (NOT `.callout.alert`) — frame as early warning, not alarm.

```html
<div class="callout insight">
  <div class="callout-title">Reorder Pattern Change</div>
  <p><strong>Account-level:</strong> {{CURRENT_GAP}} days since last order — {{RATIO}}x their normal cadence (avg every {{AVG_INTERVAL}} days). Worth a check-in.</p>
  {{IF predicted_next_order_window available:}}
  <p><strong>Predicted next order window:</strong> Based on their historical cadence, this account's next order was expected around {{EXPECTED_DATE}} ({{DAYS_OVERDUE}} days ago). {{IF seasonal_pattern: "This account historically orders heaviest in {{PEAK_MONTHS}} — the window is {{closing/open}}."}} </p>
  {{/IF}}
  <p><strong>Item-level:</strong></p>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Item</th><th>Description</th><th>Reorder Cycles</th><th>Avg Interval</th><th>Current Gap</th><th>Ratio</th><th>LTM Revenue</th></tr>
    {{ROWS_FOR_ITEMS_WITH_DECAY}}
  </table>
  <p>Dollar exposure if pattern persists: ${{SUM_LTM_OF_DECAYED_ITEMS}} in items where reorder frequency has stretched.</p>
</div>
```

Only include item rows where SIG-DECAY-02 fired. If only SIG-DECAY-01 (account-level) fired, omit the item table and show only the account-level paragraph.

**Predicted Next Order Window** (render when sufficient history exists):
- Compute `expected_next_order_date = last_order_date + avg_interval`
- If `expected_next_order_date` is in the past, show how many days overdue: "Expected around [date] — now [N] days past their normal cadence."
- If `expected_next_order_date` is in the future, show as a deadline: "Based on pattern, next order expected around [date] — [N] days from now."
- **Seasonality enhancement**: If the account's order history shows clear seasonal peaks (>50% of annual volume concentrated in specific months from Q-21 data), add the seasonal context: "This account historically orders heaviest in January and October — you're now past their October window with no reorder." This turns a generic decay signal into a TICKING CLOCK.
- If insufficient history (< 5 reorder cycles), omit the predicted window silently.

### E. Stock-Out Impact (conditional: SIG-ANOMALY-02 fired for items this account buys)

```html
<div class="callout insight">
  <div class="callout-title">Fulfillment Gap</div>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Item</th><th>Description</th><th>LTM Revenue (this account)</th><th>Qty Available</th><th>Next Receipt</th></tr>
    {{ROWS}}
  </table>
  <p>{{N}} items this account orders are currently out of stock, representing ${{SUM}} in LTM revenue. Proactive communication about restock timing protects the relationship.</p>
</div>
```

### F. Competitive Displacement (conditional: SIG-ANOMALY-03 fired for this account)

```html
<div class="callout insight">
  <div class="callout-title">Channel Share Shift</div>
  <p>eCat orders: {{ECAT_YOY}}% (${{ECAT_PRIOR}} → ${{ECAT_LTM}})</p>
  <p>Total business: {{TOTAL_YOY}}% (${{TOTAL_PRIOR}} → ${{TOTAL_LTM}})</p>
  <p>This account's total business is {{growing/flat}} but a smaller share flows through the platform. Re-engaging them on eCat could recapture an estimated ~${{GAP}}.</p>
</div>
```

### G. Pre-Meeting Priority (MANDATORY for every mini-brief)

A single bold sentence at the bottom of each mini-brief. The single most important thing to do about this account.

```html
<p class="prose"><strong>Priority:</strong> {{ONE_SENTENCE_ACTION}}</p>
```

This must name a specific action (call, email, visit), a specific person if rep data available, and reference the highest-ranked signal for this account.

---

## Additional Subsections (after mini-briefs)

**Render order follows the narrative arc**: Intelligence → Opportunity → Risk.
Subsections are numbered for reference but render in the order below, not
numerically.

### 3b. eCat Penetration of Total Business per Customer (Q-52) — INTELLIGENCE

**MANDATORY RENDER**: If `cache/Q-52_results.md` exists AND contains data rows AND `PORTAL_CUSTOMER_DATA_PRESENT = true` in `gate_flags.md`, this subsection MUST appear in the fragment. Omit ONLY when the file is absent, contains zero rows, or the gate is false.

**Data source**: `cache/Q-52_results.md`

**Rendering**: Table with top 15 customers by total business GMV:

| Column | Content |
|--------|---------|
| Customer Name | Display name (never expose `customer_code`) |
| State | Customer state |
| Total Business Orders | All-channel order count |
| Total Business GMV | All-channel GMV |
| eCat Orders | eCat-originated order count |
| eCat GMV | eCat-originated GMV |
| eCat Penetration % | `ecat_gmv / total_business_gmv × 100` |

Highlight customers with eCat Penetration > 50% using `.row-highlight` class. Show top 5 visible; remaining in a collapsed `<details>` element.

```html
<div class="subsection">
  <div class="subsection-title">eCat Penetration of Total Business</div>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Customer</th><th>State</th><th>Total Orders</th><th>Total GMV</th><th>eCat Orders</th><th>eCat GMV</th><th>Penetration</th></tr>
    {{ROWS — top 5 visible, rest in <details>}}
  </table>
  <div class="what-this-means">{{PENETRATION_NARRATIVE}}</div>
</div>
```

**Framing principle**: The penetration spread tells a story about where eCat is winning and where it hasn't landed yet. The what-this-means should identify geographic or customer-segment patterns: "Your New York accounts average 45% eCat adoption while your California accounts average 8% — is that a territory coverage gap or a market difference?" Frame penetration as a winnable game: "Going from 8% to 20% in California alone would add an estimated $X in eCat orders."

**Claim rules**: Reference by `customer_name` only — never expose `customer_code`. "Your top account does $X in total business — Y% flows through eCat." Customers at 0% penetration are legitimate — they buy through other channels but haven't adopted eCat. Frame constructively as activation opportunity, not failure. Never use "ERP."

### 4. Dormant High-Value Accounts (conditional: SIG-RISK-02 signals exist) — RISK (render late)

Source: Q-17 filtered by SIG-RISK-02 threshold ($15K+ historical spend, 90+ days silent).

```html
<div class="subsection">
  <div class="subsection-title">Dormant High-Value Accounts</div>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Customer</th><th>State</th><th>Last Order</th><th>Historical GMV</th><th>Silence vs Normal</th></tr>
    {{ROWS — top 5 visible, rest in <details>}}
  </table>
  <div class="what-this-means">{{ACTION_IMPLICATIONS}}</div>
</div>
```

"Silence vs Normal" column: show current gap in days and the ratio to normal cadence (e.g., "244 days — 4.7x normal").

### 5. Unactivated High-Value Accounts (conditional: SIG-OPP-02 signals exist) — OPPORTUNITY

Source: Q-53 filtered by SIG-OPP-02 threshold ($50K+ total business, zero eCat).

```html
<div class="subsection">
  <div class="subsection-title">Unactivated High-Value Accounts</div>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Customer</th><th>State</th><th>Total Business GMV (LTM)</th><th>Total Orders</th><th>eCat Orders</th></tr>
    {{ROWS — top 5 visible, rest in <details>}}
  </table>
  <div class="what-this-means">{{ACTIVATION_OPPORTUNITY_NARRATIVE}}</div>
</div>
```

Frame as "These accounts represent $X in proven demand flowing through other channels. Zero customer acquisition cost — this is pure activation."

### 5b. Enterprise Channel Accounts (conditional: ENTERPRISE_CHANNEL exclusion set is non-empty) `[COLLAPSE]`

**Gate**: Render ONLY if the signal detection pass identified ≥ 1 account as `ENTERPRISE_CHANNEL` (LTM orders ≥ 500 AND 0 lifetime eCat AND org `HAS_CART = false`).

**Purpose**: These accounts (national retailers, big-box chains, marketplace platforms) were EXCLUDED from SIG-OPP-02 because they order via EDI/PO/marketplace — not candidates for iPad activation. This callout acknowledges their existence transparently rather than letting them silently disappear.

**Display**: `[COLLAPSE]` — informational, not actionable.

```html
<details class="subsection collapsed">
  <summary class="subsection-title">Enterprise Channel Accounts ({{N}} excluded from activation analysis) &#9662;</summary>
  <p class="prose">The following accounts are high-volume buyers (500+ orders/year) with zero eCat history. They order through enterprise channels (EDI, direct PO, or marketplace integration) and are not candidates for eCat iPad activation. They are excluded from the "Unactivated High-Value" analysis above.</p>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Account</th><th>State</th><th>Total Business GMV (LTM)</th><th>LTM Orders</th><th>Channel</th></tr>
    {{ROWS — all enterprise accounts, sorted by GMV descending}}
  </table>
  <p class="prose"><strong>Note:</strong> If any of these accounts should be considered for eCat activation (e.g., the relationship has changed or B2B Cart is being added), flag them for reclassification in the next report cycle.</p>
</details>
```

**Channel column**: Infer from order patterns — "EDI/Direct PO" for all (since we can't see the actual channel, the volume + zero eCat pattern implies non-eCat ordering). Do NOT speculate on specific channel names beyond this.

**Claim rules**: Frame neutrally — these are NOT failures or missed opportunities. "Enterprise channel accounts operate outside eCat by design." Never suggest these accounts are problems to solve.

### 6. Geographic Distribution (conditional: geographic concentration or gaps are interesting)

**SKIP if distribution is uniform.** Only render if one state/region accounts for > 30% of revenue OR a clear geographic cluster exists. This is a conditional subsection — do not force it.

If rendered: use a compact table (State, Accounts, LTM GMV, % of Total) with enrichment from Q-54 if available. Collapse after top 5 states.

### 7. Velocity Deceleration Alerts (conditional: SIG-DECAY-04 signals exist) — RISK (render late)

Source: Q-ORG-CONTRACTION filtered by SIG-DECAY-04 threshold (YoY decline > 20%, LTM > $50K).

```html
<div class="subsection">
  <div class="subsection-title">Accounts Contracting Year-Over-Year</div>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Customer</th><th>State</th><th>Prior Year GMV</th><th>LTM GMV</th><th>YoY Change</th><th>Dollar Decline</th></tr>
    {{ROWS — top 5 visible, rest in <details>}}
  </table>
  <div class="what-this-means">{{CONTRACTION_IMPLICATIONS}}</div>
</div>
```

YoY Change column: use `.badge.danger` for > 30% decline, `.badge.warn` for 20–30%.

### 8. Reorder Velocity & Early Warning (Q-14, Q-14b)

Build from `Q-14_results.md`. Surface reorder frequency patterns and flag accounts showing declining reorder velocity as early churn warnings.

**Gate**: Always render from Q-14. Q-14b enrichment is MANDATORY when its gate is met.

**Rendering**: Show top 5 high-frequency buyers and flagged decelerating accounts.

```html
<div class="subsection">
  <div class="subsection-title">Reorder Velocity & Early Warning</div>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Account</th><th>State</th><th>Orders (LTM)</th><th>Avg Interval (days)</th><th>LTM Revenue</th></tr>
    {{ROWS — top 5 high-frequency buyers}}
  </table>
</div>
```

**8b. Account Velocity Deceleration Alert (Q-14b)**

**MANDATORY RENDER**: If `cache/Q-14b_results.md` exists AND contains data rows AND `HAS_PORTAL_ORDERS = true` in `gate_flags.md`, this enrichment MUST be rendered as a second part within subsection 8. Omit ONLY when the file is absent, contains zero rows, or the gate is false.

**Data source**: `cache/Q-14b_results.md`

**Rendering**: After the Q-14 reorder frequency table, add a `.callout.alert` titled "Deceleration Alert" followed by a table:

| Column | Content |
|--------|---------|
| Account | Customer name (never expose `customer_bill_to_number`) |
| Historical Avg | Historical average order interval (days) |
| Recent Avg | Recent 6-month average order interval (days) |
| Deceleration | Ratio displayed as "X.Xx" (e.g., "1.8x") with `.badge.danger` if ≥2.0, `.badge.warn` if 1.5–1.99 |
| Annual Value | LTM all-channel GMV for this account |

Sort by annual GMV descending. Show top 5 visible; remaining in collapsed `<details>`.

```html
<div class="callout alert">
  <div class="callout-title">Deceleration Alert</div>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Account</th><th>Historical Avg</th><th>Recent Avg</th><th>Deceleration</th><th>Annual Value</th></tr>
    {{ROWS — top 5 visible, rest in <details>}}
  </table>
  <div class="callout-summary">X accounts show order frequency stretching beyond 1.5x their historical average. Combined annual value at risk: $Y.</div>
</div>
<div class="what-this-means">These accounts are ordering less frequently than their established pattern. If this trend continues, projected at-risk revenue is approximately $Z. Proactive outreach to understand the cause — whether it's seasonal, competitive, or operational — is the highest-leverage action for your team right now.</div>
```

**Claim rules**: "These accounts are ordering less frequently than their established pattern." Always hedge projections: "If this trend continues, projected at-risk revenue is approximately $Z." Use "all-channel order frequency" — never "portal orders" or "ERP." Reference accounts by name only.

### 9. Untapped Category Opportunities (Q-57) — OPPORTUNITY

**MANDATORY RENDER**: If `cache/Q-57_results.md` exists AND contains data rows AND `HAS_PORTAL_ORDERS = true` AND `PORTAL_CUSTOMER_DATA_PRESENT = true` in `gate_flags.md`, this subsection MUST appear in the fragment. Omit ONLY when the file is absent, contains zero rows, or either gate is false.

**Data source**: `cache/Q-57_results.md`

**Rendering**: Open with a `.callout.insight` block titled "Untapped Category Opportunity" with a summary: "Your top accounts have zero purchases in X categories where similar accounts are actively buying. Estimated addressable whitespace: $Y." Compute X as count of distinct `missing_category` values; compute Y as sum of `addressable_gap` across all rows.

Then render a table with top 10 rows sorted by `peer_median_spend` descending:

| Column | Content |
|--------|---------|
| Customer | `customer_bill_to_name` (never expose `customer_bill_to_number`) |
| Missing Category | `missing_category` |
| Customer Annual GMV | `customer_annual_gmv` formatted as currency |
| Peer Median Spend | `peer_median_spend` — what similar accounts spend in this category |
| Peers Buying | Count of other accounts actively purchasing in this category |

Show top 5 visible; remaining in collapsed `<details>`.

<div class="subsection">
  <div class="subsection-title">Untapped Category Opportunities</div>
  <div class="callout insight">
    <div class="callout-title">Untapped Category Opportunity</div>

  </div>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Customer</th><th>Missing Category</th><th>Annual GMV</th><th>Peer Median Spend</th><th>Peers Buying</th></tr>
    {{ROWS — top 5 visible, rest in <details>}}
  </table>
  <div class="what-this-means">These gaps represent product categories where your existing accounts are buying nothing — but similar accounts are actively purchasing. Each row is a specific conversation starter for your reps: "You buy heavily in Lighting but nothing in Mirrors — other accounts your size typically do both." This isn't a guarantee of captured revenue, but it identifies the lowest-friction expansion paths.</div>
</div>
```

**Claim rules**: Always use hedging language — "estimated addressable whitespace," "if adoption matched peer behavior," "opportunity, not certainty." Never guarantee dollar amounts are capturable. Use "similar accounts" not "peers" in client-facing text. Never expose `customer_bill_to_number`. Never use "ERP" — use "your account base" or "accounts in your system."

### 10. Buyer-Within-Account Intelligence (Q-66) — INTELLIGENCE

**Gate**: Render ONLY if `HAS_PORTAL_ORDERS = true` AND `HAS_BUYER_DATA = true` AND `cache/Q-66_results.md` has data rows.

**Display**: Standalone (NOT collapsed). New decision-maker detection within existing accounts — a unique signal no other section provides.

**Data source**: `cache/Q-66_results.md`

**Rendering**: Open with a `.callout.insight` titled "New Decision-Maker Detection" summarizing: "X of your accounts show a new buyer placing orders in the last 90 days. The highest-impact: [top account] added a new contact who placed $Y in their first engagement. New decision-makers signal either internal expansion or a changing buying committee — both demand immediate rep attention."

Compute `X` as row count. Identify the top row by `new_buyer_revenue`.

Then render a table of accounts with new buyers (sorted by `new_buyer_revenue` descending):

| Column | Content |
|--------|---------|
| Account | `customer_bill_to_name` |
| New Buyers | `new_buyers` |
| Existing Buyers | `existing_buyers` |
| New Buyer Orders | `new_buyer_orders` |
| New Buyer Revenue | `new_buyer_revenue` formatted as currency |

  <table>
    <tr><th>Account</th><th>New Buyers</th><th>Existing Buyers</th><th>New Buyer Orders</th><th>New Buyer Revenue</th></tr>
    {{ROWS — top 5 visible, rest in <details>}}
  </table>
  <div class="what-this-means">A new name placing orders within an existing account is one of the clearest signals that your customer relationship is evolving — either the business is growing and bringing on additional buyers, or a new decision-maker has taken over the account. In both cases, your rep needs to know immediately. Proactive outreach to these contacts — while they're still forming vendor preferences — is the highest-ROI relationship action available.</div>
</div>
```

**Claim rules**: Never expose `buyer_name` or `customer_bill_to_number`. Use only account name. Frame as "new decision-maker detected" — expansion opportunity that demands immediate rep relationship-building. Never use "ERP." Never reveal internal buyer identifiers.

### 11. Geographic Revenue Trends (Q-67) — INTELLIGENCE

**MANDATORY RENDER**: If `cache/Q-67_results.md` exists AND contains data rows AND `HAS_PORTAL_ORDERS = true` AND `PORTAL_CUSTOMER_DATA_PRESENT = true` in `gate_flags.md`, this subsection MUST appear in the fragment. Omit ONLY when the file is absent, contains zero rows, or either gate is false.

**Display**: Standalone (NOT collapsed). Quarter-over-quarter geographic shift analysis.

**Data source**: `cache/Q-67_results.md`

**Rendering**: This is a standalone geographic analysis subsection (separate from subsection 6's static distribution view). Open with a `.callout.insight` titled "Geographic Revenue Shifts" with a punchy data-driven headline. Build it dynamically:

1. Identify the state with the largest positive `gmv_change_pct` — this is the "breakout market."
2. Identify the state with the largest negative `gmv_change_pct` — this is the "contracting market."
3. Construct the headline: "[Breakout state full name] grew [X]% quarter-over-quarter ($[prior]→$[current]) while [contracting state full name] contracted [Y]%. Your reps added [N] net new customers in growing states — that's market share being won in real time."

Use full state names in the callout headline (Virginia, not VA). Table rows may use abbreviations.

Then render a table of states (top 15 by `current_gmv` descending):

| Column | Content |
|--------|---------|
| State | `state` (abbreviation acceptable in table) |
| Current Quarter | `current_gmv` formatted as currency |
| Prior Quarter | `prior_gmv` formatted as currency |
| QoQ Change | `gmv_change_pct` with `.badge.ok` if positive, `.badge.warn` if -1% to -10%, `.badge.danger` if < -10% |
| Customers | `current_customers` (show `customer_change` as +/- delta, e.g., "643 (+30)") |

    {{ROWS — top 10 visible, rest in <details>}}
  </table>
  <div class="what-this-means">Geography isn't static — it shifts quarter to quarter as reps win or lose momentum. States gaining both revenue and customers are proof of effective coverage; states losing revenue (especially while customer counts hold steady) may signal competitive displacement or shrinking wallet share. Use this as a territory-planning input: where you're growing, double down on coverage; where you're contracting, investigate whether you're losing deals or losing the relationship.</div>
</div>
```

**Claim rules**: Never attribute decline to a specific named competitor or specific cause — say "may indicate competitive pressure," "could signal a coverage gap," or "warrants investigation." Frame growing states as momentum to protect and declining states as requiring attention. Use full state names in headline callouts; abbreviations are acceptable in table cells. Never use internal field names. Never use "ERP."

### 12. Spending Contraction Detection (Q-68) `[COLLAPSE]` — RISK (render last)

**MANDATORY RENDER**: If `cache/Q-68_results.md` exists AND contains data rows AND `HAS_PORTAL_ORDERS = true` AND `PORTAL_CUSTOMER_DATA_PRESENT = true` in `gate_flags.md`, this subsection MUST appear in the fragment. Omit ONLY when the file is absent, contains zero rows, or either gate is false.

**Display**: `[COLLAPSE]` — useful directional insight but historical-peak comparisons are approximate. Collapse keeps the section scannable while making this available for detail-oriented readers.

**Data source**: `cache/Q-68_results.md`

**Methodology**: Compare each account's trailing-12-month spend to their own **historical peak spending period** (highest rolling 12-month total in their order history). This surfaces accounts with a demonstrated spending capacity that has contracted — accounts that HAVE spent more, not accounts that SHOULD spend more based on peers.

**Methodology explanation (MUST include in rendered output)**: Before the table, include a `.prose` paragraph:

> "We compare each account's trailing-12-month spend to their own historical peak — the highest rolling 12-month total in their order history. This surfaces accounts with a demonstrated spending capacity that has contracted. These are accounts that have spent more in the past, making re-engagement a recovery conversation rather than a cold growth pitch."

This explanation must appear every time this subsection renders — it is not optional.

**Rendering**: Open with a `.callout.insight` titled "Spending Contraction: Accounts Below Their Peak" summarizing: "X accounts are spending below their historical peak. The combined gap between current and peak spend represents $Y in demonstrated capacity that has not been recaptured."

Compute `X` as row count. Compute `Y` as sum of `gap_to_peak` across all rows.

Then render the methodology explanation `.prose` paragraph (above).

Then render a table of accounts with highest contraction (sorted by `gap_to_peak` descending):

| Column | Content |
|--------|---------|
| Account | `customer_bill_to_name` |
| State | `primary_state` |
| Current Annual Spend | `customer_spend` formatted as currency |
| Historical Peak Spend | `peak_spend` formatted as currency |
| Contraction | `gap_to_peak` formatted as currency with `.badge.warn` styling |
| Current vs Peak | `current_vs_peak_pct` displayed as percentage (e.g., "38% of peak") |

Show top 8 visible; remaining in collapsed `<details>`.

```html
<div class="subsection collapsed">
  <div class="subsection-title">Spending Contraction Detection</div>
  <div class="callout insight">
    <div class="callout-title">Spending Contraction: Accounts Below Their Peak</div>
    <p>{{X}} accounts are spending below their historical peak. The combined gap between current and peak spend represents ${{Y}} in demonstrated capacity that has not been recaptured.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="prose">We compare each account's trailing-12-month spend to their own historical peak — the highest rolling 12-month total in their order history. This surfaces accounts with a demonstrated spending capacity that has contracted. These are accounts that have spent more in the past, making re-engagement a recovery conversation rather than a cold growth pitch.</p>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Account</th><th>State</th><th>Current Annual Spend</th><th>Historical Peak</th><th>Contraction</th><th>Current vs Peak</th></tr>
    {{ROWS — top 8 visible, rest in <details>}}
  </table>
  <div class="what-this-means">These accounts have a demonstrated spending capacity that exceeds their current level — they've proven they can buy at their peak amount, and something changed. The contraction could reflect competitive displacement, changing business needs, relationship drift, or simply a market cycle. What makes these accounts high-value targets is that the rep conversation isn't "you should spend more" — it's "you used to spend $X, what changed?" That's a fundamentally different and more productive dialogue.</div>
</div>
```

**Claim rules**: Always use "demonstrated capacity," "historical peak," and "contraction" — not "should be spending" or "underperforming." Frame as recovery opportunity, not failure. Never expose internal identifiers. Never use "ERP."
